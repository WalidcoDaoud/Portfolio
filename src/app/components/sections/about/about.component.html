        <p class="story-text">
          I started studying Computer Engineering in 2021, drawn to its role as
          the future of innovation. Though fascinated by both hardware and
          software, I chose programming for its creative problem-solving
          potential. Now, I'm focused on building impactful solutions through
          code while continuously expanding my skills.

          I began my career as a Technical Support Intern in a consulting
          company, handling L1 tasks like user management, access control, and
          direct client troubleshooting. This experience sharpened my
          problem-solving skills and my communication skills, before I
          transitioned into frontend development, where I now combine technical
          expertise with a user-focused mindset.

          Currently I am working as a Fullstack Developer at a consulting
          company, I work on diverse projects using Angular, React, Material UI,
          and Angular Material for frontend development. On the backend, I
          primarily work with .NET, along with SQL Server and MongoDB for
          database solutions. This role allows me to combine my passion for
          clean, responsive UIs with robust, scalable backend systems. Every
          project is a chance to improve. I'm constantly learning,
          experimenting, and refining my skills to write cleaner code, design
          more efficient systems, and grow as a developer.

                I earned my Computer Engineering degree with a thesis project
                that developed a real-time geolocation monitoring system. The
                hardware solution utilized ESP32 microcontrollers, while the
                software stack featured a NestJS backend API paired with a
                dynamic Next.js frontend interface.
