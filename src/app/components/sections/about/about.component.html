        <p class="story-text">
          Currently I am working as a Fullstack Developer at a consulting company, I work on diverse projects using Angular, React, Material UI, and Angular Material for frontend development. On the backend, I primarily work with .NET, along with SQL Server and MongoDB for database solutions. My toolkit includes Zustand for state management, RxJS for reactive programming, and JWT-decode for authentication, with Blob Storage handling data persistence. I optimize workflows using GitHub for version control, CI/CD pipelines for deployment, and maintain code quality through ESLint and Husky pre-commit hooks. Each project presents an opportunity to improve. I'm constantly learning, experimenting, and refining my skills to write cleaner code, design more efficient systems, and grow as a developer.

          I began my career as a Technical Support Intern in a consulting
          company, handling L1 tasks such as user management, access control, and
          direct client troubleshooting. This experience sharpened my
          problem-solving skills and my communication skills, before I
          transitioned into frontend development, where I now combine technical
          expertise with a user-focused mindset.

          I started studying Computer Engineering in 2021, drawn to its role as
          the future of innovation. Though fascinated by both hardware and
          software, I chose programming for its creative problem-solving
          potential. Now, I'm focused on building impactful solutions through
          code while continuously expanding my skills.

                I earned my Computer Engineering degree with a thesis project
